        <h2> Current video and photo trends with AI</h2>
        <p>A lot of videos and images are made by AI. While some people use AI to edit their images, some images or videos are completely made by AI. This is becoming a problem because while it seems harmless, some of these fake or AI videos are spreading misinformation. AI videos can include fake news or fake events taking place in the world. AI images are also misleading or make things look unrealistic.</p>
        <h2>Current video and photo trends without AI</h2>
        <p>As for pictures without AI, retro or vintage styled images where the image is faded or grainy is starting to make a comeback. People seem to like this style because it's simple and has many imperfections that make the picture look nostalgic. Simple and minimalist pictures are also popular because they usually contain very simple or empty pictures but contain strong meanings behind them. For videos, people are making short form videos because they are fast and addicting for people to watch. These videos are also extremely easy and short to make.</p>
